# Examples
These examples are meant to test with the local toolbar-android changes.

# How to run: 

 - install `@react-native-community/toolbar-android` from local repo: `yarn sync` (this is a passive sync, i.e. you need to do this manually when you want to test the changes)
 - test: `yarn test`
 - run: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`
